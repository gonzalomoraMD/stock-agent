### **AI Stock Market Prediction Agent**

This project implements an AI-driven agent that analyzes and predicts stock market trends using real-time data. It leverages AI tools and APIs to fetch stock data, process it, and provide predictive insights. The agent uses advanced models to make data-driven decisions and help users understand stock performance.

#### **Key Features:**
- **Real-Time Data Integration**: Fetches stock data and financial information via APIs.
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Utilizes AI models (e.g., LangChain, Mistral) for data interpretation and stock trend predictions.
- **User Interaction**: Accepts stock symbols and current prices as input, providing predictions and insights in response.
- **Automated Decision Making**: Autonomous predictions based on historical data and trends.

#### **Technologies Used:**
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **AI Tools**: LangChain, Mistral (or any chosen model)
- **Data Sources**: Stock market data APIs
- **Framework**: Streamlit for user interaction (optional)

#### **Setup Instructions**:
1. Install necessary libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Pull the latest model using `ollama pull model_name`
3. Run the AI agent script to start predictions.

#### **Future Enhancements**:
- Integrate more data sources for more comprehensive analysis.
- Implement advanced predictive models to improve accuracy.
